Lienau PDF-Analyzer (2025)

ReWa FEMA Image
Processing & Reorder Engine
A Web-App

Purpose
This application is designed to automatically process and reorder PDF documents containing FEMA forms based on identifying numbers found within the images. It specifically looks for and extracts numbers following the "400C-" pattern in the documents, then reorders the pages based on these extracted numbers.
It provides a robust solution for automatically reordering FEMA cleanup image document pages based on their internal numbering system, significantly reducing manual processing time and potential errors in document organization.

Key Features
1.	PDF Processing
•	Accepts PDF file uploads
•	Allows processing of entire documents or a specified number of pages
•	Converts PDF pages to high-quality images for OCR processing

2.	OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
•	Uses Google Cloud Vision API for highly accurate text extraction
•	Specifically targets and extracts "400C-" numbered sequences
•	Includes fallback pattern matching for various number formats

3.	Intelligent Page Reordering
•	Automatically sorts pages based on extracted numbers
•	Handles missing or unreadable numbers gracefully
•	Maintains original page references for tracking

4.	Real-time Progress Tracking
•	Visual progress bar showing processing status
•	Detailed debug console for monitoring operations
•	Page-by-page processing updates

5.	Result Preview
•	Shows processed pages with extracted text
•	Displays original and processed page numbers
•	Provides visual confirmation of page content

6.	Export Functionality
•	Generates a new, reordered PDF file
•	Maintains original image quality
•	Includes processing logs for documentation

Processing Flow

1.	Document Upload
•	User selects PDF file
•	System validates file format and size
•	Initial page count displayed

2.	Processing Phase
•	Pages are extracted from PDF
•	Each page is converted to high-quality image
•	Images are sent to Google Cloud Vision API
•	Text is extracted and analyzed for numbers
•	Pages are tagged with extracted numbers

3.	Reordering Phase
•	Pages are sorted based on extracted numbers
•	Missing or invalid numbers are handled
•	New page order is established

4.	Preview and Verification
•	Processed pages displayed with extracted data
•	Original vs. new order shown
•	Error cases highlighted

5.	Export
•	New PDF generated with reordered pages
•	Processing logs created
•	Final document available for download

Error Handling
•	Retries failed OCR attempts
•	Handles network connectivity issues
•	Manages API rate limiting
•	Provides detailed error reporting
•	Allows for manual intervention when needed

Performance Considerations
•	Batch processing for large documents
